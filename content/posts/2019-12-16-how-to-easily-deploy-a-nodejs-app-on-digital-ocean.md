Hello fellow coders.

Maybe you have a nodejs app, and you need to deploy it on a cloud provider.

I suggest you to have a look on [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com). It's an easy to use cloud provider, with a lot of different templates for all your project, with a cheap price and a good server architecture.
