In 2018, I quit everything to go and travel the world for 15 months.

**Wow! Amazing! This is a lifetime experience! Why did you do that?**

You have already heard someone telling you: "_I don't like my life... I want to travel... But I can't because of my job and my cat. \*Crying face\*_"

15 months I was a bit like that, with a good but -not so exciting- job in a healthcare startup, my own apartment, and good friends with whom it was easy to re-imagine everything. **But it wasn't enough**. With my girlfriend (ex-, \*sick\*), we decided to quit our jobs and go discover the world.

We first went to **New-Zealand**, the country of kiwis (the bird, the local people and the fruit) and The Lord of the rings. We spend 10 months there, only travelling by Van, moving from place to place, sleeping in beautiful places and doing awesome activities (Kayaking in the sea, fishing, trekking, ...).

Some of our best pictures just for _you_:

Awesome, isn't it?

After this wholesome travel, we decided to go to **Australia**, and _make some money_! We worked for vintages in two companies. No no, not the picking. But at producing the wine after reception and pressing.
We did this job for two months and managed to leave Australia with almost _10 000 AUD_!

However, this is not the end of the journey.

With that amount of money, we moved from Australia to **South-East Asia** and we did **Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia** (1 month each)... Fabulous!

Here you go, more great pictures just for _you_:

After this lifetime experience/travel, we decided to go back to France.

## Technological retreat during this time

It's really cool to travel and discover the world, but if you can do that by working as a freelance, it's even better!

Maybe you already did it, or you are actually doing it, so that's great ;) 

However, what I learned from this experience is that when you are travelling -in the goal of discovery-, you don't have the time to work on your computer. Imagine, waking up at 6 o'clock, taking your breakfast quickly, driving for 2hours, just to start an awesome trek for the day or visiting this mystic temple that you don't want to miss (_hello angkor wat_), and doing that almost every day... **I guarantee you that at the end of the day**, the only thing you will do is sleeping, or maybe drinking one or two cocktails.

I started this journey with my computer in my bag, and threw it in a trash after few months.

Yes yes, I know. I'm a web developer, I'm doing IT since 5 years at a professional level, I started learning computer things at 13 years old... but after **10 years in this field**, it's good to have a big break (_aka technological retreat_), and do something with your fingers. 

I literally came back with the envy to continue in IT, and _keep going into what I was good_. In fact this is why I decided to go back to school, and continue in the school [EPITECH](https://www.epitech.eu/fr/), at Montpellier. I want to get my **Professional Master Degree** in two years. I will make some posts about it in the future, but this is for an other story.
