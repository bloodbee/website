Good morning, dear readers,

It's been a long time since I've done a post! Do you remember, in my last post, I mentioned the fact that I was entering a professional master's degree at Epitech?
That was six months ago.

It's done and I think that a little feedback is needed.

## What is Epitech?

It's the first French computer science school to adopt a "project" pedagogy. Long before, the school 42 of Xavier Niel (who is one of the former founders of Epitech).

To make it short, there are no courses, just various and varied projects.

Each project will refer to a module, for example mobile development or digital transformation.

There is a certain number of skills to validate in each module.
