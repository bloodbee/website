In 2020, the general council of the mececin allowed health practitioners to have more visibility on the internet by creating a website that highlighted their specialty and activity.

Doctor Philippe Galtier came to see me because he wanted to have more and more patients.

During the covid period, he hoped to diversify into additional activities for **skin rejuvenation** such as [cryolipolysis](https://drgaltier-aveyron.com/cryolipolyse), [pressotherapy](https://drgaltier-aveyron.com/pressotherapie), and [pulsed light](https://drgaltier-aveyron.com/lumiere-pulsee) for his young and less young patients.

I was able to design his website with the goal of emphasizing these three activities while providing **as much information as possible** about them.

Furthermore, the website provides all of the **necessary information to contact** him, schedule an appointment on Doctolib, or even visit him in his office.

For the stack, I used [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) for the frontend, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the design, [Netlify](https://netlify.com) as host provider and [Netim](https://www.netim.fr/) as domain provider.

*If you ever visit Sauveterre de Rouergue, you should book a rendezvous with him and try a skin rejuvenation session.*
