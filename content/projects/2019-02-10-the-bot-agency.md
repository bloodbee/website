In 2017, I launched [The Bot Agency](https://thebotagency.xyz). A startup specialized in conversational and automatized chatbots.

In 2017, the chatbot market was valued at $100 million and according to Global Market Insights, the amount is expected to jump in 2024 to **$1.34 billion**. 

I thought : _This is the time to jump in it_.

So I created The Bot Agency, and started to make few chatbots that you can find on facebook :

* SearchBot
* MapBot
* Domainot

I looked after few tools to help me in this processus, using [Chatfuel](https://chatfuel.com), Botanalytics, or directly from scratch with NodeJS + Heroku.

For the last month 'january 2019), SearchBot has got 100 new users, 400 conversations and 700 messages. That's not awesome, but it keeps going up everyday since the launch in september 2017.
