Welcome into my space !

Passionate about computers for many years, and more specifically WEB technologies. My job gave me the opportunities to work on various projects, each one more formative than the other, in order to reach today a total fulfillment in what I undertake at the professional level.

**I will use this space to test my ideas, show you my work, speak about what I like and don't like. Sometimes it could be awesome or just stupid. But hey, that's my space.**

<blockquote>From scratch or frameworks, from backend or frontend, in the cloud or not, versioned or not, as I'm trying to become a full-stack web developer, I can be anywhere or just somewhere.</blockquote>

Feel free to [contact me](/contact) for more information about my projects.
