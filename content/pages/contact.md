I try not to be overbooked and overwhelmed by the projects, so I suggest that you contact me in these cases:
+ You have a website, blog, whatever **idea** and need someone to handle that for you.
+ You have a company and you want a **chatbot** to reduce costs for your support.
+ You have a company and you can offer me a **good opportunity**. (Why not?)
+ You like **cryptocurrencies** (as I do) and want to **invest** in it, but don't know how.
+ You want to buy me **a beer or a coffee**, just because you think I'm cool.
